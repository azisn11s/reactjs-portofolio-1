# Developer Portfolio

A clean, responsive developer portfolio built with React and SCSS.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Custom SCSS**: Styled using semantic SCSS with variables and mixins (no utility classes).
- **Dark Mode**: Automatically detects system preference and includes a manual toggle in the header.
- **Local Assets**: All images are stored locally in the project.

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: React components (Header, Hero, Projects, Contact, Footer).
- `src/styles`: SCSS files including variables, global styles, and component-specific styles.
- `src/assets/images`: Local image assets.

   npm install
   ```

2. **Run development server**:
